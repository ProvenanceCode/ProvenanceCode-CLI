## 🎯 Strategic Success

### Perfect Boundary Maintained

| Feature | CLI (Free) | GitHub App (Paid) |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Individual productivity | ✅ All features | ✅ Enhanced |
| Team collaboration | ❌ Deliberately absent | ✅ Core value |
| Enforcement | ❌ No blocking | ✅ PR blocking |
| Dashboards | ✅ Local HTML | ✅ Real-time |
| Search | ✅ Single repo | ✅ Cross-repo |
| Approval workflows | ❌ Not included | ✅ Multi-party |

### Natural Upsell Triggers Created

1. **Sharing moment**: "Can you send me that graph?"
2. **Consistency moment**: "Everyone should use the same template"
3. **Review moment**: "Did anyone approve this?"
4. **Scale moment**: "What about other repos?"
5. **Compliance moment**: "We need audit reports"
6. **Enforcement moment**: "Can we require this?"

**Result:** CLI creates the need for GitHub App naturally.
