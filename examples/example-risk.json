  "title": "Distributed system complexity and operational overhead",
  "description": "Moving to microservices introduces significant complexity in operations, monitoring, and debugging. The team has limited experience with distributed systems patterns like circuit breakers, distributed tracing, and service mesh.",
  "severity": "high",
  "status": "monitoring",

  ],
  "mitigation": "1) Invest in comprehensive observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger). 2) Provide team training on distributed systems. 3) Start with 2-3 services before scaling. 4) Implement service mesh (Istio) for traffic management. 5) Establish clear service ownership and on-call rotation.",
  "impact": "If not properly managed, could lead to: increased system downtime, difficulty debugging production issues, slower feature development due to coordination overhead, and potential data inconsistencies.",
