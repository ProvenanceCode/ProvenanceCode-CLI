  "title": "Adopt microservices architecture",
  "status": "accepted",
  "context": "Our monolithic application is becoming difficult to scale and maintain. Teams are blocked waiting for deployments. We need to improve deployment velocity and system scalability.",
  "decision": "We will migrate to a microservices architecture over the next 12 months. We'll start by extracting the authentication service, followed by the payment processing service. Each microservice will have its own database and deploy independently.",
  "consequences": "Positive: Improved deployment velocity, better fault isolation, technology flexibility per service. Negative: Increased operational complexity, need for distributed tracing, eventual consistency challenges.",
  "risk": "Main risks include: complexity in managing distributed systems, data consistency across services, and the learning curve for the team. See RSK-MYAPP-CORE-000001 for detailed risk assessment.",
