# Contributing to ProvenanceCode CLI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ProvenanceCode CLI!

## 🎯 Project Principles

Before contributing, please understand our core principles:

### What the CLI Should Do

✅ Enable developers to adopt ProvenanceCode G2
✅ Validate record structure and schema compliance
✅ Generate templates and starter packs
✅ Provide helpful local tooling

### What the CLI Should NOT Do

❌ Enforce governance workflows
❌ Block PR merges based on approval state
❌ Manage organizational policy
❌ Track metrics or analytics
❌ Make SaaS calls or phone home

**The CLI is the open layer. The GitHub App is the governance layer.**

## 💡 Feature Requests
